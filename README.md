## 02 - made in 10 minutes

<img src="02-procreate-10_minutes/10_minutes.jpg" title="A piece of generative art composed of 9 tiles, 3 across and 3 down. Each tile is split up into rectangles and squares, and all of the tiles are rotations (90, 180, 270 degrees) of the first tile. The tiles are coloured in muted light blue, green, pink, and yellow, with a bright orangey red, and dark blue,  green, and purple. The first tile is coloured in quite neatly, but the rest grow more and more scribbled and messy." alt="A piece of generative art composed of 9 tiles, 3 across and 3 down.
