## 02 - made in 10 minutes

<img src="02-procreate-10_minutes/10_minutes.jpg" title="A piece of generative art composed of 9 tiles, 3 across and 3 down. Each tile is split up into rectangles and squares, and all of the tiles are rotations (90, 180, 270 degrees) of the first tile. The tiles are coloured in muted light blue, green, pink, and yellow, with a bright orangey red, and dark blue,  green, and purple. The first tile is coloured in quite neatly, but the rest grow more and more scribbled and messy." alt="A piece of generative art composed of 9 tiles, 3 across and 3 down.

## 04 - intersections

<img src="04-p5-intersections/76141.jpg" title="A square generative art piece composed of 6 rows of different heights. Each row is split into two columns, and each resulting rectangle are various colours (a light vanilla, muted yellow, green, blue, and a dark blue and green). In a grid of 20x20 there are circles cut out of each rectangle, in the vanilla colour which is also the background colour. Overlaying each circle, and a few pixels up, is a different coloured circle - the same yellows, blues, and greens. Where the colourful circle intersects the rectangle background behind it, the colour of the circle is slightly darker than how it looks against the vanilla background, due to a multiply affect. There are two rectangles where the background is also vanilla, so the cut outs are not visible there - only the circles that overlay them." alt="A square generative art piece composed of 6 rows of different heights.
